            "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is an
            English-language pangram—a phrase that contains all of
            the letters of the alphabet. It is commonly used for
            touch-typing practice. It is also used to test typewriters
            and computer keyboards, show fonts, and other applications
            involving all of the letters in the English alphabet.
            Owing to its brevity and coherence, it has become widely known.

            As the use of typewriters grew in the late 19th century,
            the phrase began appearing in typing and stenography lesson
            books as a practice sentence. Early examples of publications
            which used the phrase include Illustrative Shorthand by Linda
            Bronson (1888),[3] How to Become Expert in Typewriting:
            A Complete Instructor Designed Especially for the Remington
            Typewriter (1890),[4] and Typewriting Instructor and Stenographer's Hand-book (1892).

            test phrase "THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPED OVER THE LAZY DOG'S BACK

            a message asking their American counterparts "What does it mean when
            your people say 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog?'"
